# AR-Project-Robotic-arm-ArduinoColor_changer
Created a  movable and rotatable (6df)robotic arm and game object(cube) in unity . Integrated the unity setup with Arduino using a pressure sensor and a  flex sensor to control the threshold temperature of cube by changing it color. The Robotic arm senses the cube only when it is near or in in the range of the cube
